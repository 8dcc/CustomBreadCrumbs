## Custom BreadCrumbs

### About
   This mod allows you to feed the goose to make him walk across your screen, or to calm him down when he is in a frenzy. Plus he makes cute nom sound.

### Usage
   The default button is 'RightShiftButton', however this can be changed in the Config.txt using the codes from: 
	'https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.keys?view=netframework-4.8'

### Credits
I only changed the image and the sound, I DID NOT code the mod.
